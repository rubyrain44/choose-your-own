<!-- CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE -->
The premise of this project is to use ChatGPT to help me build a choose your own adventure where the prompts allow the user to follow a journey that leads them to multiple endings.

<!-- Basic Coding Ideas -->
-Have the user begin the journey by giving their name. This will be saved in state and used in multiple instances to refer back to the player to allow for immersion.
-Have the background match the prompt on screen and whatever is happening. This will change based on how the story/game changes.
-Also have background music that changes to match the tone of the game.
-Should a user need to register or not? Or can these things just persist in state for the length of the game, and maybe added to the database for after the 
 fact viewing?


<!-- CSS Ideas -->


<!-- JS Features -->
-Color prompts: -A user can input a color into a search bar and have that then change the background color on the page perhaps.
                -Maybe use a color picker wheel to have the user find the color that matches the hidden words on the screen. This might need to be the same color as the background, but they can change the vibrancy to make the words more legible?
-Madlibs: -Possibly have a user have to input a bunch of words when prompted that get saved into state, and then the code will know how to sort through the data 
           and have those words show up properly with the complete filled in prompt. Maybe there could be a way to save these prompts for people to see after the journey has been completed.

<!-- Prompt/Script Ideas -->
-Incorporate a guestbook type thing where users have to leave something in the guestbook for the game. These will be saved and users can see everything that everyone else has written in the book as well.
